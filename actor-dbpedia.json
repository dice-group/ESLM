He is best known for playing Fu Manchu in a series of fifteen silent films collectively called The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu, all filmed in 1923, followed by a 1924 series of eight additional Fu Manchu films under the title The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu Manchu. Lyons starred in the title role of all 23 movies (which ran about 20 -25 minutes each in length), all of which featured Fu's ongoing battle with his two British nemeses, Sir Nayland Smith (played by Fred Paul) and his assistant Dr. Petrie. Both series were produced by Oswald Stoll (see List of Stoll Pictures films), who had earlier produced a 1920 film version of Sax Rohmer's 1915 \"Yellow Peril\" novel, The Yellow Claw. In spite of the many films in which Lyons played an Oriental character, the obviously British actor \"put forth little effort to make himself seem anything other than Caucasian\". He later also starred as Dr. Sin Fang, another Asian character, in a low-budget 1928 six-picture film series produced by Pioneer Productions. The Sin Fang films were produced and directed by Fred Paul (who also co-starred in them as the regularly appearing police lieutenant John Byrne) and were written by Patrick K. Heale. The Sin Fang films co-starred Evelyn Arden as Byrne's girlfriend Betty and Wally Patch as Byrne's sidekick Bill Riggers. Fred Paul (who had also directed a number of the earlier Fu Manchu films) co-produced the 6 Sin Fang films with A. M. Brooks, and created the Sin Fang character to be as similar to Fu Manchu as he could possibly be, without being sued by Sax Rohmer for copyright infringement. Of the six Sin Fang films, only the fifth one (The Torture Cage) still exists. Lyons' last two films, the cheaply-made 1937 Dr. Sin Fang sound feature and the 1938 Chinatown Nights, also both featured the Dr. Sin Fang character, but those were produced by Victory Films and were not part of the 1928 silent film series.

Born in New York City, de Renzy served in the United States Air Force as a Survival Instructor. Back in the United States, he began making documentary films in San Francisco. In October 1969, he went to Denmark to attend Sex 69, the first porn trade show hosted in Copenhagen after the legalization of adult pornography there. This resulted in his first movie, Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach (1970), which was released the following year. He was the editor on Sexual Encounter Group (1970), was a cinematographer on seven movies, and wrote five screenplays. His production Lady Freaks (1973) introduced porn star legend Annette Haven. His films also include the two 1970s porn classics (1977) and Pretty Peaches (1978). Another de Renzy discovery was Desire\u00e9 Cousteau. She won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1978 for \"Best Actress\" for her starring role in Pretty Peaches and became an international sex star. The plot of Pretty Peaches derives from Voltaire's literary classic Candide about a naive young woman undergoing a series of hardships which constitute the satire. Peaches contains a notorious enema scene (and for a time was censored from the VHS release, restored in Alpha Blue's DVD release) in which the powerful jet-spray from Cousteau's hindquarters knocks the administering physician to the bathroom floor, to which Peaches bemoans \"I don't think he could cure anything!\" A third actress de Renzy introduced to adult films was Juliet Anderson, better known as \"Aunt Peg\". He won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1977 for Best Director for \"Babyface\", and was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame.

Her background is not known. She is known to have married in 1620 to the actor Jean Valliot, who is known to have been active in 1614\u20131627 and then probably died, as she is known to have been an independent widow during her period of fame in Paris in the 1630s. She was engaged in the Grands Comediens (Com\u00e9diens du Roi) at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, which was opened in 1628. In 1632, she and five other actresses of the theatre are documented. Other actresses of the theater were Mlle Beaupr\u00e9, Mlle Bellerose, Mlle Le Noir and Mlle Beauchateau. The contemporary chronicle writer Tallemant described the Parisian actresses of the 1630s. He referred to Mlle Bellerose as a \u201cgood actress\u201d, Mlle Valliot as \u201cas beautiful a person as one could see,\u201d Mlle Le Noir as a \"as pretty a little person as one could find\", Mlle Baron as \"very pretty, not a marvelous actress, but a success thanks to her beauty\", and Mlle Beaupr\u00e9 as \"old and ugly\". Mlle Beaupr\u00e9 and Mlle Valliot are described as the two principal star actresses of the theatre. The repertoire of the theatre are documented and clearly show that roles for women are provided for in the plays, but it is not confirmed which actor played which role. They appear to have been known for farce and breeches roles. They are known to have played the two major roles as the wives of Gaultier and Boniface in the farce La Comedie des comediens by Gougenot in 1632\u201333. Abraham Bosses famous engraving of Les Farceurs de l'Ho\u02c6tel de Bourgogne of the three great comic stars of the company, Gros-Guillaume, Gaultier-Garguille, and Turlupin, also shows a young woman with one hand on Guillaume's arm, distracting Gaultier, who failed to notice Turlupin stealing his purse. This likely portrayed an actress of the theatre, likely Mlle Valliot, who plays the \u201cfemme de Gaultier\u201d in Gougenots play. She had a love affair with the fifteen years younger abb\u00e9 Armenti\u00e9res, who later became the marquis d\u2019Armenti\u00e9res, and who reportedly financed her and supported her after she left the stage and retired.", "resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elisabeth_Dispannet", "class": "actor"}, {"abstract": "Elizabeth Bennett is a British actress and television producer.

She was an influential advocate for modern architecture in the United States. Elizabeth Bauer Mock Kassler was born in Lexington, Massachusetts in 1911 as Elizabeth Bauer to Alberta Krouse Bauer, a homemaker, and Jacob Bauer, a New Jersey state highway engineer. Her older sister was Catherine Bauer Wurster, a prominent public housing advocate and urban planning educator, and her younger brother was Louis Bauer. She graduated from the Vail Deane School in 1928. In 1932 she graduated from Vassar College, where she majored in English. After college she became one of the first fellows at Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Taliesin studio near Spring Green, Wisconsin. It was at Taliesin where she met her first husband, Rudolph Mock, a draftsman from Basel, Switzerland who worked in Wright\u2019s studio from January 1931 to April 1933. After their marriage, they briefly lived in Switzerland. Her involvement with the MoMA started in 1937 when she began working part-time for the museum\u2019s Curator of Architecture and Industrial Design, . A year later she co-circulated her first exhibition, \u201cWhat is Modern Architecture?\u201d. She became McAndrew's full-time assistant in 1940. When McAndrew was dismissed in 1942, Mock became the director. She remained at MoMA until 1946. During her time there, she produced many exhibits, including: \u201cBuilt in the U.S.A.: 1932\u20131944\u201d (1944), \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Small House: Models and Plans\u201d (1945), and \u201cIf You Want to Build a House\u201d. She curated seven MoMA exhibitions in total between 1938 and 1946. In 1946 and 1947, she and Rudolph lived in Knoxville, TN designing pre-fab housing for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Some of the buildings were in Fontana Village. In 1948, she separated from Rudolph and moved to Taliesin West with her son Fritz for one season. In 1949 she became an assistant professor of architectural history and librarian at the University of Oklahoma. After her divorce, she married Kenneth Stone Kassler in 1951 and moved to Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton she continued to write for architecture journals, the MoMA, and popular magazines. Kassler died in 1964, the same year Bauer became a research associate at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at Princeton University where she served until 1971. According to Concordia University's Research Chair in Art History, Kristina Huneault, Mock's books \"strove to persuade a new generation of homebuyers of how modernism might improve their lives and the quality of North American architectural culture overall.\u201d They include If You Want to Build a House (1946), The Architecture of Bridges (1949), and Modern Gardens and the Landscape (1964, known then as Elizabeth B. Kassler). Her book on bridges is described by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica as \"the first major book on bridges to give a modern viewpoint.\" Modern Gardens and the Landscape is considered the authoritative survey of its subject. It was billed by the MoMA as \"the first book to discuss the relationship between the modern garden and the natural landscape in terms of contemporary aesthetics.\" Modern Gardens and the Landscape included the works of Burle Marx, Bernard Rudofsky, Gunnar Asplund and Luis Barragan. Her books were all published by the Museum of Modern Art.

He is unique in the extant records of English Renaissance theatre, in that his individual employment contract with one of his acting companies has survived. Dawes was an early and perhaps an original member and \"sharer\" (a partner who shared in the profits, rather than a hired man who worked for a wage) with Prince Charles's Men, from at least 1610 on. He remained with that company only until 1614, however, when he left for the Lady Elizabeth's Men. Dawes was admitted as a sharer in the Lady Elizabeth's troupe; his personal 3-year contract with managers Philip Henslowe and Jacob Meade, dated 7 April of that year, spells out a schedule of graduated penalties for minor and major infractions of the rules: \n* If Dawes was late for a rehearsal, he had to pay a fine of \"twelve pence,\" one shilling (1 s.). \n* If he missed a rehearsal entirely, the fine was 2 s. \n* If he was late for a performance, the fine rose to 3 s. \n* If he was drunk at the start of a performance (in the judgement of four troupe members), the fine was 10 s. \n* If he missed a performance with no adequate excuse, the fine rose to one pound (\u00a31). \n* And if he was found guilty of appropriating any of the company's expensive costumes or other property (as by wearing a costume outside the theatre), the fine was a hefty (almost astronomical) \u00a340.

Historically, some early cars used transmission brakes as the normal driving brake and often had wheel brakes on only one axle, if that. In current vehicles, these brakes are now rare. They are found in some makes, notably Land Rover, usually for light off-road vehicles. Simple transmission brakes could be found in large vehicles too, such as the 16 inch single disc parking brake used in the M19 Tank Transporter of World War II. Such a system was also used on the HMMWV. The transmission brake is provided solely as a parking brake or handbrake. Normal wheel brakes are still provided for use when driving, drum brakes originally, now almost always disc brakes. Driver's manuals usually caution against using the transmission brake when driving, as it is neither powerful enough nor robust enough and so will not work effectively and may even be damaged by trying to stop a moving vehicle. Transmission brakes use drum brakes, rather than disc brakes, as they are intended as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic brake. Drum brakes allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box. As the transmission brake is mounted inboard of the final drive and its reduction gearing, the brake rotates relatively faster, but with less torque, than a wheel brake. The apparently undersized transmission brake thus has more holding ability than its small size might suggest, but is less suitable for driving loads. The braking forces would also be passed through the final drive and axle drive shafts, with possible risk of overloading them. One advantage of a transmission brake is that it locks the entire drivetrain, including all four wheels of a four wheel drive vehicle. However any differential action, either within an axle or front-to-back on an all wheel drive (permanent 4\u00d74) vehicle can still allow movement. For this reason a transmission brake is convenient as a parking brake, but should not be relied upon if a mechanic is to be working beneath the vehicle and wheel chocks should be used instead. A second advantage is that they remove the need to provide cable connections to the wheel brakes, on off-road vehicles where such may be prone to damage.", "resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transmission_brake", "class": "actor"}, {"abstract": "Trevor Mills Byfield (20 October 1943 \u2013 11 October 2017) was a British character actor particularly well known for his roles on British television.

His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan), and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury.

The brake works by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat. Steam is emitted during braking but this does not come from the boiler, it is produced by evaporation of water used to cool the cylinders.

It uses the working principle of steam cylinders fitted with slide or piston valves such that, by changing the configuration of the valve gear, the motion of the valves is also altered such that they work in opposition to the movement of the pistons. Because of the inertia of a steam locomotive in its initial direction of travel, changing the direction in which the steam cylinders have to work acts first to brake the movement of the connecting rod, which in turn slows the transmission of power to the drive of the locomotive until it stops.

Cox had one known connection with one of the theatre companies of the era: he was one of ten men who tried to re-organize the King's Men in December 1648, an attempt that, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. Cox won his personal fame in writing and performing drolls \u2014 interludes or farces that usually consisted of comic scenes extracted and adapted from old dramas of English Renaissance theatre, by William Shakespeare (Bottom the Weaver was one droll), Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and many others. Cox created at least eleven drolls, with titles like Simpleton the Smith, Bumpkin, Hobbinat, Simpkin, and John Swabber the Seaman. As a performer, Cox was said to have been \"irresistible\" in his role of Young Simpleton. Cox performed most often at the Red Bull Theatre, long a center of popular entertainment. By some reports he bribed local officials into looking the other way when his drolls grew too much like plays. If so, he was not entirely successful in his corruption: Puritan authorities raided the Red Bull in June 1653 looking for unauthorized drama, and found Cox, playing Swabber. The gentry among the audience were required to pay five-shilling fines to exit.

Born in Chichawatni, Punjab, she grew up in a village (49/12 L, Subhanpur) 360 kilometers south of Islamabad. She started running at the age of 14. She had to overcome huge obstacles to compete internationally, the main objection being raised was how a Pakistani woman could race in a competition in which other women do not wear clothes that cover their body. Her parents, especially her father, encouraged her to run, but in the predominantly Muslim country she had to train in, it had to be done at 2:30 in the morning with a brother biking to pace her, because female athletes were not allowed to run on the road. She realized that if she qualified, she would have to wear a jogging suit while others wore shorts. Girls in Pakistan, when allowed to take part in sports, must wear such suits. She describes running qualifying races in the daytime in her home country where spectators were lining the sidelines not to cheer, but to throw rocks and tomatoes at her.
